# JapanesePractice
Replicating a lost program I wrote for practicing hiragana/katakana, which has
since had its scope expanded to include practicing Japanese overall.

## Purpose
A target-language-agnostic framework for practicing language skills. The
language pair focused on by development is English-Japanese, but design
decisions try to keep the application from being strictly tied to this.

## Building
Development primarily occurs within Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition. At
the time of writing (2017/11/26) the Visual Studio Installer does not include
an option to install .NET Framework 4.7.1; the developer pack can be located
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/net471-developer-pack).
